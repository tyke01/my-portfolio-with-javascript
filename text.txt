Include the bash-wakatime.sh file in your ~/.bashrc file with this command:

source path/to/bash-wakatime.sh

But if you already have a PROMPT_COMMAND variable set, just merge your own pre_prompt_command with the following one.

Make sure your API Key is in your ~/.wakatime.cfg file.

Open a new terminal and type commands.

Activity from the bash plugin always goes in the Terminal project, so visit https://wakatime.com/projects/Terminal to see your coding activity.
